<h1>OpenGL 4.5 Reference Pages</h1>

<p> Use the index on the left to choose any OpenGL reference page for
    viewing. There are two forms of the index which can be selected by
    clicking at the top of the index; a traditional flat index combining
    the API commands and GLSL functions, and an accordion-style index
    with separate sections for commands and functions. The flat index
    also includes per-letter section links. </p>

<p> The reference pages include all of the important usage information
    for each command and function. This information includes a
    description of all parameters, return values, error conditions,
    related commands and functions, and version support.</p>

<h2>Core Context Functionality</h2>

<p> These man pages only document OpenGL 4.5 core context functionality.
    For compatibility context specific functionality, please refer to
    the OpenGL 2.1 Reference Pages and/or the appropriate extension spec
    you are interested in using.</p>

<h2>Browser Compatibility</h2>

<p> The man pages are now generated in HTML5 format with imbedded MathML,
    and rely on <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> to render
    mathematical equations on browsers which do not natively support MathML.
    This should work much better on Chrome, Safari, and other browsers which
    don't support MathML natively. </p>

<p> However, HTML5 isn't well supported on IE 8 or earlier versions. We
    recommend you use a more recent browser for viewing the man pages. </p>

<h2>Downloading Man Page Sources</h2>

<p> The Docbook XML source for the man pages is available for anonymous
    checkout in Khronos' Subversion server, and you can build a man page
    distribution of your own using open source tools. See the OpenGL.org
    technical Wiki pages describing the <a
    href="http://www.opengl.org/wiki/Getting_started/XML_Toolchain_and_Man_Pages">
    XML Toolchain and Man Pages</a> for more information. </p>
