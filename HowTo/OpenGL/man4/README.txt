The OpenGL API reference page sources have been upgraded to Docbook5 and
merged with the Shading Language reference pages. This directory
contains the current, complete set of reference pages.

The old Docbook4 sources and XHTML Transitional output versions of the
API reference pages are available under docbook4/ for the time being,
although they are no longer being updated and will eventually be
removed. They are also available in Subversion history prior to Feburary
10, 2014, and will remain available.
